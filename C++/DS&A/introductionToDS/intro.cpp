/*
A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it canbe used efficiently.

We can talk about data structures as:
1) Mathematical/ logical models or also known as Abstract Data Types
Abstract Data Types: define data and operations but no implementation
    ex of Abstract Data Type:
        List:
            - stores a given number of elements of any type
            - reads elements by position
            - modifies an element at a given postion
2) Implementation 
    ex of Concrete Implementation:
        Arrays
        Linked List
